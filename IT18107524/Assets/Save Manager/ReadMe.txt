Version 1.0.2 Change Log:

* Store Listing Changes *
- Updated the asset title to remove the "(CG)" characters after the asset name. This has been replaced with "| CG" instead to look a little neater.
- Updated the main asset description to explain more about the asset and its features. 
- Updated all links to be correct for the asset.
- Updated to key images to all be the same size as the main key image.
- Updated the asset colour scheme to be more pastel, the old colour was a bit abrupt.

* Asset Changes *
+ Updated the Save Manager Logo on the asset editor window.
+ Updated the priority of the Save Manager in the Carter Games navigation tab menu.
+ Corrected the spacing for Save Data Editor in the navigation tab menu.
+ Updated commenting on all code.
+ Updated the example in the asset so that the user can refer back to it without needing the savedata class to be set in a particular way.
+ Name spaced all example code into CarterGames.Assets.SaveManager.Example so that the user does not accidently use example code instead of the asset itself.
+ Added a new method to reset the save file when called.
+ Cleared the savedata class so it is ready for the user to add their own stuff right away.
